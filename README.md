# Project_1_Basic_Business_Website

## Meaghann Wallace

### Overview/Description of Project:

The overview of the project was to design a basic business or personal website with the followng required features: a GitHub respository for the project, user stories, wireframes of each application window, and functional website features.
These features are: three HTML pages, a CSS style sheet, a navigation bar, one image, a form with three fields, a multi-column layout page, 15+ GitHub commits, and no HTML validator errors/warnings.

### Function/Usablity of Website

The Home page offers a functional carousel option to look through three bakery images as well as a navigation bar. The next section welcomes and greets the customer, instructing them to look at the Bakery Items page for products, and the About Us page for information 
about the company. The Bakery Items page allows the user to look through the different pastry items the shop offers along with a little description of each one. The About Us page shares information about the business, and a form for the user to fill out if they would 
like to sign up for the newsletter and/or want to place a catering order. There is a 'Submit' button for them to press to complete this action.

### Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Bootswatch

### Ideas for Future Improvement

2. Add a shopping cart feature for online orders.
3. Add a product customization option for online orders.
4. Add a light/dark mode feature on the website.
5. Add a register account feature for customers to track order status.
